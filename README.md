The Digital Signature Sighter Signing module for XOOPS 2.5 is a module that allows your users of 
your website to have a self signed digital certificate store on your site; the module also has an
API that allows any other website via a self discovery API in the headers of the module to dial a
site and get with their specified document identication and details with search results for
authentication with their signature through calling the api from a parrallel site, you can see this
in API Calling routines help on the api in the demo.

So when a client of you website generates a signature their is a set of fields in the XOOPS_LIB folder
that defines all the fields and tables of information for a signature; this is currently set for 100
points ID Signatures with the ID Uploaded and stored - now the interesting thing veristy parity of signed.

Which once you have establised a xoops_data/signed you will not be able to move it with out starting the
Signatures from start, these are also encrypted if you turn it on with the new cryptus class with the
module.
